Active Directory

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

1. Explain the concept of Active Directory.

Active Directory is Microsoft's trademarked directory service
Active Directory is a centralized and standardized system that automates network management of user data, security, and distributed resources, and enables interoperation with other directories.
Active Directory is designed especially for distributed networking environments.

Active Directory features include:
Support for the X.500 standard for global directories
The capability for secure extension of network operations to the Web
A hierarchical organization that provides a single point of access for system administration (management of user accounts, clients, servers, and applications, for example) to reduce redundancy and errors
An object-oriented storage organization, which allows easier access to information
Support for the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to enable inter-directory operability
Designed to be both backward compatible and forward compatible

----------------------------------

2. What is the purpose of deploying Active Directory?

Basic Functions of Microsoft Active Directory.
Active Directory is a distributed directory service included with Microsoft Windows Server operating systems.
Active Directory enables centralized, secure management of an entire network, which might span a building, a city, or multiple locations throughout the world.

----------------------------------

3. Differentiate between a local server and a domain controller.

A local area network (LAN) server is a program (and by implication usually the computer it runs in) that "serves" the resources
(files, storage, application programs, printers, and other devices) for a number of attached workstations.

A domain controller is a server that is running a version of the Windows Server operating system and has Active Directory Domain Services installed.
In Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2008, the directory service is named Active Directory Domain Services.

----------------------------------

4. Explain the difference between a tree and a forest in Active Directory.

The forest, tree, and domain are the logical divisions in an Active Directory network.

A tree is a collection of one or more domains and domain trees in a contiguous namespace, linked in a transitive trust hierarchy.

At the top of the structure is the forest. A forest is a collection of trees that share a common global catalog, directory schema, logical structure, and directory configuration.
The forest represents the security boundary within which users, computers, groups, and other objects are accessible.

Forest -> Group of trees, Same schema, GC
Trees -> Group of domains, Same namespace, trust
Domain -> Own DC, AD

----------------------------------

11. Describe the purpose of partitioning a disk? Can a partition be used entirely for data? - Yes

Disk partitioning or disk slicing is the creation of one or more regions on a hard disk or other secondary storage, so that an operating system can manage information in each region separately.
Partitioning is typically the first step of preparing a newly manufactured disk, before any files or directories have been created.

----------------------------------

12. Name the different types of disk partitions? Examples include the primary and extended partitions. Where is the operating system normally installed?

primary partitions
extended partitions
logical drives

Administrator
This group has complete control over all domain controllers and all directory content stored in the domain, and it can change the membership of all administrative groups in the domain.
It is the most powerful service administrative group.

Backup Operator
By default, this built-in group has no members. It can perform backup and restore operations on domain controllers.

Account Manager / Account Operators
By default, this built-in group has no members. It can create and manage users and groups in the domain, but it cannot manage service administrator accounts.
As a best practice, do not add members to this group, and do not use it for any delegated administration.

----------------------------------

17. Study the different components of a server management console. The management console is abbreviated as MMC to mean Microsoft Management Console.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Management_Console

Microsoft Management Console (MMC) is a component of Windows 2000 and its successors that provides system administrators and advanced users an interface for configuring and monitoring the system.

Disk drive can contain a maximum of four primary partitions or three primary partitions and a single extended partition.
Only a single extended partition can be contained in a hard disk.
But the extended partition could be subdivided in to several partitions called logical partitions.
Extended partition acts as a container for logical partitions.

----------------------------------

46. Can disk quote be allocated on a server for each user? - Yes

Disk quotas track and control disk space usage for NTFS volumes, allowing administrators to control the amount of data that each user can store on a specific NTFS volume.

Server Manage - > Add role and features -> Role based or feature based installation -> IIS -> Install

----------------------------------

48. What is meant by a role of a server?

Windows Server 2008 is designed around certain roles and features.
A role is a primary duty that a server performs.
For example, you typically would point at a server and say "that's my domain controller (DC) and DNS server."
A feature is something that helps a server perform its primary duty (Windows Backup, network load balancing).
Certain roles are comprised of sub-elements called Role Services, which are distinct units of functionality.
For example, within the role of Terminal Services, is the TS Gateway and TS Licensing Role Services (among others)

Name:	yahoo.com
Address: 206.190.39.42

➜  ~

----------------------------------

149. Explain the term “MX Record”. What is the composition of a “MX Record”?

The MX resource record specifies a mail exchange server for a DNS domain name.
The information is used by Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to route emails to proper hosts.
Typically, there are more than one mail exchange server for a DNS domain and each of them have set priority.

➜  ~  nslookup -query=mx yahoo.com
Server:		192.168.1.1
Address:	192.168.1.1#53

150. What information does these two records contain in a DNS server? For example, the MX record contains information relating to the mail server on the network.

The record A specifies IP address (IPv4) for given host.
A records are used for conversion of domain names to corresponding IP addresses.

The MX resource record specifies a mail exchange server for a DNS domain name.
The information is used by Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to route emails to proper hosts.
Typically, there are more than one mail exchange server for a DNS domain and each of them have set priority.

----------------------------------

151. What is meant by the term Scavenging?

Scavenging is a feature that allows the cleanup and removal of stale resource records in DNS zones.
A stale resource record will be removed only if scavenging is enabled on:
- The resource record
- The DNS zone where the resource record exist
- At least one DNS hosting a primary copy of the DNS zone where the resource record exist

Scavenging occurs on recurring interval when enabled on a DNS server.
A stale resource record can then still exist until the next cycle of DNS scavenging.

----------------------------------

152. Is it necessary to configure a DNS server using a static IP address?

Yes

----------------------------------

153. What is meant by a forward lookup zone?

Domain Name -> IP Address
