- Hybrid Clouds
    - Hybrid cloud is a cloud computing environment which uses a mix of on-premises, private cloud and third-party, public cloud services with orchestration between the two platforms. By allowing workloads to move between private and public clouds as computing needs and costs change, hybrid cloud gives businesses greater flexibility and more data deployment options. 
    Eg - an organization may run an application primarily in its private cloud, but tap into public cloud resources during periods of peak demand. Or it may run an application primarily in a public cloud environment while keeping some data relating to that application in its private cloud for compliance reasons.
