    - Increase the communication speed of a single communication session
 	- Example - modem and ISDN transmission, ATM , Video Conferencing, T1

----------------------------------

2. Describe the following multiplexing techniques: Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) and Statistical Time Division Multiplexing (STDM).

TDM
    - Time division simply allows a fixed period of time for communication for each channel 
    - Each channel is assigned a fixed period of time for transmission
    - The opportunity to transmit is given on a round-robin basis
    - Time division multiplexers can therefore processes the information in digital form
    - A modem is only required to connect a multiplexer to an analog line

FDM
    - Channel division is based on frequency.
    - Each channel is assigned A different frequency (Half-duplex Example)
    
STDM
    - STDM is similar to TDM except for one difference
    - A time slice may be shortened due to the absence of data for transmission
    - Each channel is initially assigned a fixed period of time
    - The time period is forfeited in part or in full if there is no data to be transmitted  
    - Obviously, STDM is more efficient than TDM

----------------------------------

2. What are the upper layers, middle layers and the lower layers of the ISO/OSI model?

----------------------------------

3. Explain the purpose and use of the ISO/OSI model.

- Communication
    - Established standards
    - Standards are known as protocols
- Implementation
    - A framework is helpful in the design of hardware and software for communication
    - ISO-OSI Model serves this purpose
    - ISO-OSI supersedes the TCP/IP model 
- The model acts as a frame of reference in the design of communications and networking products

----------------------------------

4. Draw a data packet and mark its components. Hint: Receiver's address would be one of the components. 

- Synchronization Information
- Receivers Address
- Senders Address
- Data
- Control Data
- Error Correction Protocol

----------------------------------

5. List the IEEE standards that are applicable to the lower layer communication in the case of LANs. Examples include IEEE 802.3.

802 Data link and physical layers
    - 802.1 Internetworking
    - 802.2 Logical Link Control (LLC)
    - 802.3 CSMA/CD
    - 802.4 Token Bus LAN

----------------------------------

6. Name some of the lower-layer operations.

Data Link layer - MAC address - Frame
Network layer - Source and Destination IP - Packet
Transport layer - TCP or UDP
Application layer - Application Specific Message
                        - Web page in case of HTTP
