Section 1: Overview of TCP/IP

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. What is meant by the TCP/IP suite of protocols? Explain RFC and IETF in relation to this protocol.

The Internet protocol suite is the conceptual model and set of communications protocols used on the Internet and similar computer networks.
It is commonly known as TCP/IP because the original protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).

RFC
Request for Comment
It is a document published by IETF to define internet related standards, such as TCP/IP.

IETF
Internet Engineering Task Force
It is a non-profit organization that sets Internet Standards, such as TCP/IP, and publishes the RFCs.

|                                                      OSI(Open System Interconnection)                                                      |                                                        TCP/IP(Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)                                                         |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1. OSI is a generic, protocol independent standard, acting as a communication gateway between the network and end user.                    | 1. TCP/IP model is based on standard protocols around which the Internet has developed. It is a communication protocol, which allows connection of hosts over a network. |
| 2. In OSI model the transport layer guarantees the delivery of packets.                                                                    | 2. In TCP/IP model the transport layer does not guarantees delivery of packets. Still the TCP/IP model is more reliable.                                                 |
| 3. Follows vertical approach.                                                                                                              | 3. Follows horizontal approach.                                                                                                                                          |
| 4. OSI model has a separate Presentation layer and Session layer.                                                                          | 4. TCP/IP does not have a separate Presentation layer or Session layer.                                                                                                  |
| 5. OSI is a reference model around which the networks are built. Generally it is used as a guidance tool.                                  | 5. TCP/IP model is, in a way implementation of the OSI model.                                                                                                            |
| 6. Network layer of OSI model provides both connection oriented and connectionless service.                                                | 6. The Network layer in TCP/IP model provides connectionless service.                                                                                                    |
| 7. OSI model has a problem of fitting the protocols into the model.                                                                        | 7. TCP/IP model does not fit any protocol                                                                                                                                |
| 8. Protocols are hidden in OSI model and are easily replaced as the technology changes.                                                    | 8. In TCP/IP replacing protocol is not easy.                                                                                                                             |
| 9. OSI model defines services, interfaces and protocols very clearly and makes clear distinction between them. It is protocol independent. | 9. In TCP/IP, services, interfaces and protocols are not clearly separated. It is also protocol dependent.                                                               |
| 10. It has 7 layers                                                                                                                        | 10. It has 4 layers                                                                                                                                                      |

3. Name some of the WAN and LAN related protocols in the lower layer of the TCP/IP Model. Differentiate between the two types of protocols.

Doubt

----------------------------------

4. Explain the protocol known as Telnet and its usage.

Telnet port - 23
It is a network protocol that allows a user on one computer to log onto another computer that is part of the same network.

----------------------------------

5. List some of the upper layer protocols.

HTTP
SMTP
Telnet
FTP

----------------------------------

6. Explain the purpose and function of the following protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, POP3 IMAP, SNMP, TELNET, TCP, UDP and ARP. Briefly describe incoming and outgoing mail protocols.

HTTP - 80
Hypertext Transfer (or Transport) Protocol, the data transfer protocol used on the World Wide Web.

HTTPS - 443
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to. The 'S' at the end of HTTPS stands for 'Secure'. It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted.

FTP - 21
The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network.

SMTP - 25
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is a TCP/IP protocol used in sending and receiving e-mail.

POP3 - 110
Post Office Protocol 3 is a protocol for receiving email by downloading it to your computer from a mailbox on the server of an Internet service provider.

IMAP - 143
IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is a standard email protocol that stores email messages on a mail server, but allows the end user to view and manipulate the messages as though they were stored locally on the end user's computing device(s).

SNMP - 161, 162
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a popular protocol for network management.
It is used for collecting information from, and configuring, network devices, such as servers, printers, hubs, switches, and routers on an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

Telnet - 23
It is a network protocol that allows a user on one computer to log onto another computer that is part of the same network.

TCP
Transmission Control Protocol
Host-to-Host Transport Layer protocol
One-to-one and connection-oriented reliable protocol (receive acknowledgement).
Used in the accurate transmission of large amount of data.
Slower compared to UDP because additional error checking being performed.

UDP
User Datagram Protocol
Host-to-Host Transport Layer protocol
One-to-one or one-to-many, connectionless and unreliable protocol.

ARP
Address Resolution Protocol
Network layer protocol used to convert an IP address into a physical address

Doubt

----------------------------------

7. What are port numbers? Indicate the de facto port numbers for the above protocols.

TCP requires port numbers on the host and destination for communication. Different port numbers are assigned to different protocols by default. Standard port numbers have been assigned by the Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA).
Note: when using a default port, you do not need to indicate the port number for communication.

DNS
Domain Name System
Application Layer/Operation related protocol
Resolves domain names to IP Addresses and vice versa

----------------------------------

| TCP rearranges data packets in the order specified.                                                                                                                | UDP has no inherent order as all packets are independent of each other. If ordering is required, it has to be managed by the application layer. |
| The speed for TCP is slower than UDP.                                                                                                                              | UDP is faster because error recovery is not attempted. It is a "best effort" protocol.                                                          |
| There is absolute guarantee that the data transferred remains intact and arrives in the same order in which it was sent.                                           | There is no guarantee that the messages or packets sent would reach at all.                                                                     |

| TCP is heavy-weight. TCP requires three packets to set up a socket connection, before any user data can be sent. TCP handles reliability and congestion control.   | UDP is lightweight. There is no ordering of messages, no tracking connections, etc. It is a small transport layer designed on top of IP.        |
| TCP does Flow Control. TCP requires three packets to set up a socket connection, before any user data can be sent. TCP handles reliability and congestion control. | UDP does not have an option for flow control                                                                                                    |
| TCP does error checking and error recovery. Erroneous packets are retransmitted from the source to the destination.                                                | UDP does error checking but simply discards erroneous packets.

UDP
games
video conferencing
UDP used for multimedia transmissions (video and game files)
audio casting (multicasting, broadcasting)

TCP
HTTP
FTP
SMTP

----------------------------------

10. Explain the terms connection-oriented and connection-less protocols. Include in the discussion, the terms reliable and unreliable communications.

Connection-Oriented protocol
They perform handshaking to set up an end-to-end connection
Connection-Oriented systems can only work in bi-directional communications environments.
Connection-oriented protocol services are often reliable network services, that provide acknowledgment after successful delivery.

Connectionless protocol
Usually achieved by transmitting information in one direction, from source to destination without checking to see if the destination is still there, or if it is prepared to receive the information.
IP, UDP, ICMP, DNS, TFTP and SNMP are examples of connectionless protocols in use on the Internet.
Connectionless transmissions are considered unreliable because the service provider usually cannot guarantee that there will be errors in the delivery of the packet.

----------------------------------

11. Files can be downloaded using the HTTP protocol or the FTP protocol. Which one is better suited for file downloads?

HTTP is more responsive for request-response of small files, but FTP may be better for large files if tuned properly.
FTP used to be generally considered faster.
FTP requires a control channel and state be maintained besides the TCP state but HTTP does not.
There are 6 packet transfers before data starts transferring in FTP but only 4 in HTTP.

----------------------------------

12. Name the incoming and outgoing protocols for an email application such as Outlook?

Doubt

----------------------------------

13. Explain the terms connection-oriented reliable protocol and connection-less unreliable protocol.

Same

----------------------------------

14. List the basic types of ISDN services. What is the difference between a data channel and a service channel? Explain in terms of B and D channels.

Integrated Services Digital Network has multiple channels, allows for transmission of data, voice, video and type of services over traditional circuit lines (telephone network).

ISDN has two B-channels and one D-Channel.

B Channel:
is a data channel used to transmit data and voice.
B channel is circuit switched (static path).

D channel:
is a services channel used for monitoring and control of the data transmission.
D channel is packet switched (dynamic path).

----------------------------------

15. Describe the term Bandwidth on Demand or BOND.

Inverse multiplexing is also known as bonding when it is done dynamically.
Multiple communication lines will be combined on as needed basis for higher speeds and bandwidth (on demand).

----------------------------------

16. Explain the application of the SNMP protocol. How does it related to manageable network devices?

SNMP: Simple Network Management Protocol.
Application Layer protocol.
Facilitates the management of SNMP compliant routers, bridges, switches etc. by enabling the collection and exchange of network management information.
Used by network management utilities to manage network devices from a remote monitor.
For example, a manageable hub that supports SNMP (has SNMP supporting software burnt within itself) can be managed from a remote location using a SNMP based LAN management software.

----------------------------------

17. What is the purpose of the ARP protocol?

Address Resolution Protocol.
Internet Layer protocol.
Resolves IP addresses to Mac addresses

----------------------------------

18. Name some application layer protocols and their corresponding de facto port numbers?

19. Group the protocols into application protocols and network infrastructure protocols.

Application protocols: Telnet, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP4, HTTP, HTPS, SNMP, DNS, RIP
Network infrastructure protocols: Ethernet, Token Rings, Frame Relay, ATM

----------------------------------

20. When scanning a port, a port can be in any one of three states. What are the states? An example of a state is “Open”.
Relate each state to the presence of software and hardware firewalls on the network.

Open
Closed
Stealth

Section 2: IP Addressing Explored

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. What are octets? How many octets are there in an IPv4 address?

Octet = 8 bits
IPv4 address -> 4 octets
32 bit address

----------------------------------

2. Describe the basic format of an IPv4 and an IPv6 protocol.

IPv4
4 octets - 32 bits
Logical components: Network ID and Host ID
10101111 11001100 10000001 00110011 = 175. 204.129.51

IPv6
8 x 16-bit fields
2001:0000:3238:DFE1:63:0000:0000:FEFB
Each 16-bit field is represented by its Hexadecimal conversion, separated by a colon (:)

----------------------------------

3. What are the two components of the IP address? Explain the terms network ID and host ID.

The two components are: Network ID and Host ID. The length of each component is determined by the IP address class

Network id: The part of an IP address that identifies the network.
Host id: The part of an IP address that identifies a host in a network.

----------------------------------

4. Practice converting decimal numbers into binary numbers and vice versa.

----------------------------------

5. Convert 01001 to its decimal equivalent and convert 14 to its binary equivalent.

01001 = 9
14 = 1110

----------------------------------

6. How many classes are there in IPv4 address space?

A, B, C, D and E.

----------------------------------

7. Explain the functions and purpose of the classes A, B, C, D and E.

Classes A, B, and C II addresses are used for commercial purposes.
Class D IP addresses are used for multicasting.
Class E IP addresses are used for experimental addresses reserved for future use.

----------------------------------

8. Give the number of networks and hosts that can be supported in classes A, B and C.

Valid number of networks:

Class A= 126
Class B= 16,384
Class C= 2,097,152

Valid number of hosts within each network:
Class A= 16,777,214
Class B= 65,534

----------------------------------

9. Describe the purpose of the class D address space.

Multicasting

----------------------------------

10. Explain unicasting, multicasting and broadcasting.

Unicasting: delivers one stream from one host another host. Multiple streams travel through the Internet to reach multiple clients separately.
Multicasting: Delivers a single stream of media to a router at the receiving end. The router multiplies and delivers the stream to local hosts. As such, one stream travels through the Internet thus saving bandwidth.
Broadcasting: Similar to multicasting, broadcasting sends one stream through the Internet. The destination multiplies and delivers the stream to local hosts regardless of the fact that the hosts do or do not request to receive the broadcast.

----------------------------------

11. Provide all the valid network IDs for class A and class B networks.

Class A: 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0
Class B: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0
Class C: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0

----------------------------------

12. In class B networks, what bits are always set to 1 and 0?

The first two higher-order bits are always set to 1 and 0 respectively.

----------------------------------

13. Are there any restrictions on the assignments of IP addresses such limiting the use of IP addresses with certain formation of ones and zeros?

All bits cannot be set to all ones, or all zeros
In class A, Network ID 127 is reserved for loopback function.

----------------------------------

14. What is IPv6? How many bits are there in an IPv6 address?

IPv6
8 x 16-bit fields
2001:0000:3238:DFE1:63:0000:0000:FEFB
Each 16-bit field is represented by its Hexadecimal conversion, separated by a colon (:)
Provides 4 times more addresses.

----------------------------------

15. Describe the motivation behind developing the IPv6 addressing scheme.
What are some of the advantages of using IPv6 addresses?
Can IPv6 addresses be configured automatically by the system? - Yes

IPv6 was developed because IP addresses provided by IPv4 are being totally consumed and new/additional addresses were needed.
Provides 4 times more addresses.
