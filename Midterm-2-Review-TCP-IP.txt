Section 1: Overview of TCP/IP

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. What is meant by the TCP/IP suite of protocols? Explain RFC and IETF in relation to this protocol.

The Internet protocol suite is the conceptual model and set of communications protocols used on the Internet and similar computer networks.
It is commonly known as TCP/IP because the original protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).

RFC
Request for Comment
It is a document published by IETF to define internet related standards, such as TCP/IP.

IETF
Internet Engineering Task Force
It is a non-profit organization that sets Internet Standards, such as TCP/IP, and publishes the RFCs.

|                                                      OSI(Open System Interconnection)                                                      |                                                        TCP/IP(Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)                                                         |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1. OSI is a generic, protocol independent standard, acting as a communication gateway between the network and end user.                    | 1. TCP/IP model is based on standard protocols around which the Internet has developed. It is a communication protocol, which allows connection of hosts over a network. |
| 2. In OSI model the transport layer guarantees the delivery of packets.                                                                    | 2. In TCP/IP model the transport layer does not guarantees delivery of packets. Still the TCP/IP model is more reliable.                                                 |
| 3. Follows vertical approach.                                                                                                              | 3. Follows horizontal approach.                                                                                                                                          |
| 4. OSI model has a separate Presentation layer and Session layer.                                                                          | 4. TCP/IP does not have a separate Presentation layer or Session layer.                                                                                                  |
| 5. OSI is a reference model around which the networks are built. Generally it is used as a guidance tool.                                  | 5. TCP/IP model is, in a way implementation of the OSI model.                                                                                                            |
| 6. Network layer of OSI model provides both connection oriented and connectionless service.                                                | 6. The Network layer in TCP/IP model provides connectionless service.                                                                                                    |
| 7. OSI model has a problem of fitting the protocols into the model.                                                                        | 7. TCP/IP model does not fit any protocol                                                                                                                                |
| 8. Protocols are hidden in OSI model and are easily replaced as the technology changes.                                                    | 8. In TCP/IP replacing protocol is not easy.                                                                                                                             |
| 9. OSI model defines services, interfaces and protocols very clearly and makes clear distinction between them. It is protocol independent. | 9. In TCP/IP, services, interfaces and protocols are not clearly separated. It is also protocol dependent.                                                               |
| 10. It has 7 layers                                                                                                                        | 10. It has 4 layers                                                                                                                                                      |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

TCP/IP - packet delivery not guarenteed, horizontal approach, 4 layers

----------------------------------

3. Name some of the WAN and LAN related protocols in the lower layer of the TCP/IP Model. Differentiate between the two types of protocols.

LAN Technology -> Ethernet, Token Ring, FDDI
WAN Technology -> X.25, Frame relay, ATM

----------------------------------

4. Explain the protocol known as Telnet and its usage.

Telnet port - 23
It is a network protocol that allows a user on one computer to log onto another computer that is part of the same network.

----------------------------------

5. List some of the upper layer protocols.

HTTP
SMTP
Telnet
FTP

----------------------------------

6. Explain the purpose and function of the following protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, POP3 IMAP, SNMP, TELNET, TCP, UDP and ARP. Briefly describe incoming and outgoing mail protocols.

HTTP - 80
Hypertext Transfer (or Transport) Protocol, the data transfer protocol used on the World Wide Web.

HTTPS - 443
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to. The 'S' at the end of HTTPS stands for 'Secure'. It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted.

FTP - 21
The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network.

SMTP - 25
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is a TCP/IP protocol used in sending and receiving e-mail.

POP3 - 110
Post Office Protocol 3 is a protocol for receiving email by downloading it to your computer from a mailbox on the server of an Internet service provider.

IMAP - 143
IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is a standard email protocol that stores email messages on a mail server, but allows the end user to view and manipulate the messages as though they were stored locally on the end user's computing device(s).

SNMP - 161, 162
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a popular protocol for network management.
It is used for collecting information from, and configuring, network devices, such as servers, printers, hubs, switches, and routers on an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

Telnet - 23
It is a network protocol that allows a user on one computer to log onto another computer that is part of the same network.

TCP
Transmission Control Protocol
Host-to-Host Transport Layer protocol
One-to-one and connection-oriented reliable protocol (receive acknowledgement).
Used in the accurate transmission of large amount of data.
Slower compared to UDP because additional error checking being performed.

UDP
User Datagram Protocol
Host-to-Host Transport Layer protocol
One-to-one or one-to-many, connectionless and unreliable protocol.

ARP
Address Resolution Protocol
Network layer protocol used to convert an IP address into a physical address

Doubt

----------------------------------

7. What are port numbers? Indicate the de facto port numbers for the above protocols.

TCP requires port numbers on the host and destination for communication. Different port numbers are assigned to different protocols by default. Standard port numbers have been assigned by the Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA).
Note: when using a default port, you do not need to indicate the port number for communication.

8. Describe the term DNS. What is the purpose of a DNS server?

DNS
Domain Name System
Application Layer/Operation related protocol
Resolves domain names to IP Addresses and vice versa

----------------------------------

9. Compare and contrast TCP with UDP. Describe one or more scenarios where one of the protocols would be more appropriate than the other. When is UDP Preferred for communication?

| TCP rearranges data packets in the order specified.                                                                                                                | UDP has no inherent order as all packets are independent of each other. If ordering is required, it has to be managed by the application layer. |
| The speed for TCP is slower than UDP.                                                                                                                              | UDP is faster because error recovery is not attempted. It is a "best effort" protocol.                                                          |
| There is absolute guarantee that the data transferred remains intact and arrives in the same order in which it was sent.                                           | There is no guarantee that the messages or packets sent would reach at all.                                                                     |

| TCP is heavy-weight. TCP requires three packets to set up a socket connection, before any user data can be sent. TCP handles reliability and congestion control.   | UDP is lightweight. There is no ordering of messages, no tracking connections, etc. It is a small transport layer designed on top of IP.        |
| TCP does Flow Control. TCP requires three packets to set up a socket connection, before any user data can be sent. TCP handles reliability and congestion control. | UDP does not have an option for flow control                                                                                                    |
| TCP does error checking and error recovery. Erroneous packets are retransmitted from the source to the destination.                                                | UDP does error checking but simply discards erroneous packets.

UDP
games
video conferencing
UDP used for multimedia transmissions (video and game files)
audio casting (multicasting, broadcasting)

TCP
HTTP
FTP
SMTP

----------------------------------

10. Explain the terms connection-oriented and connection-less protocols. Include in the discussion, the terms reliable and unreliable communications.

Connection-Oriented protocol
They perform handshaking to set up an end-to-end connection
Connection-Oriented systems can only work in bi-directional communications environments.
Connection-oriented protocol services are often reliable network services, that provide acknowledgment after successful delivery.

Connectionless protocol
Usually achieved by transmitting information in one direction, from source to destination without checking to see if the destination is still there, or if it is prepared to receive the information.
IP, UDP, ICMP, DNS, TFTP and SNMP are examples of connectionless protocols in use on the Internet.
Connectionless transmissions are considered unreliable because the service provider usually cannot guarantee that there will be errors in the delivery of the packet.

----------------------------------

11. Files can be downloaded using the HTTP protocol or the FTP protocol. Which one is better suited for file downloads?

HTTP is more responsive for request-response of small files, but FTP may be better for large files if tuned properly.
FTP used to be generally considered faster.
FTP requires a control channel and state be maintained besides the TCP state but HTTP does not.
There are 6 packet transfers before data starts transferring in FTP but only 4 in HTTP.

----------------------------------

12. Name the incoming and outgoing protocols for an email application such as Outlook?

Doubt

----------------------------------

13. Explain the terms connection-oriented reliable protocol and connection-less unreliable protocol.

Same

----------------------------------

14. List the basic types of ISDN services. What is the difference between a data channel and a service channel? Explain in terms of B and D channels.

Integrated Services Digital Network has multiple channels, allows for transmission of data, voice, video and type of services over traditional circuit lines (telephone network).

ISDN has two B-channels and one D-Channel.

B Channel:
is a data channel used to transmit data and voice.
B channel is circuit switched (static path).

D channel:
is a services channel used for monitoring and control of the data transmission.
D channel is packet switched (dynamic path).

----------------------------------

15. Describe the term Bandwidth on Demand or BOND.

Inverse multiplexing is also known as bonding when it is done dynamically.
Multiple communication lines will be combined on as needed basis for higher speeds and bandwidth (on demand).

----------------------------------

16. Explain the application of the SNMP protocol. How does it related to manageable network devices?

SNMP: Simple Network Management Protocol.
Application Layer protocol.
Facilitates the management of SNMP compliant routers, bridges, switches etc. by enabling the collection and exchange of network management information.
Used by network management utilities to manage network devices from a remote monitor.
For example, a manageable hub that supports SNMP (has SNMP supporting software burnt within itself) can be managed from a remote location using a SNMP based LAN management software.

----------------------------------

17. What is the purpose of the ARP protocol?

Address Resolution Protocol.
Internet Layer protocol.
Resolves IP addresses to Mac addresses

----------------------------------

18. Name some application layer protocols and their corresponding de facto port numbers?

----------------------------------

9. Describe the purpose of the class D address space.

Multicasting

----------------------------------

10. Explain unicasting, multicasting and broadcasting.

Unicasting: delivers one stream from one host another host. Multiple streams travel through the Internet to reach multiple clients separately.
Multicasting: Delivers a single stream of media to a router at the receiving end. The router multiplies and delivers the stream to local hosts. As such, one stream travels through the Internet thus saving bandwidth.
Broadcasting: Similar to multicasting, broadcasting sends one stream through the Internet. The destination multiplies and delivers the stream to local hosts regardless of the fact that the hosts do or do not request to receive the broadcast.

----------------------------------

11. Provide all the valid network IDs for class A and class B networks.

Class A: 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0
Class B: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0

Section 3: Subnets

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. What is subnetting? Describe the process of subnetting. Which part of the IP address is used for subnetting?

Subnetting is the division of a network into smaller network, called subnets.
Some of the Host IDs within the network IP address are used for creating subnet IDs.
Some of the higher-order bits of the HostID will be allocated to construct the subnets.

----------------------------------

2. List some of the reasons for subnetting.

A class A or class B organization may not need all its host IP addresses.
So it can subdivide its network into smaller, such as class C subnets, and give it away to other organizations.
Sometimes Subnetting can also be used for easier and more efficient management of hardware as means to deal with hardware management limitations.

----------------------------------

3. What is a subnet mask? State its purpose.

Subnet mask is a numeric parameter of a subnet used to identify the Network ID of a destination IP address by performing a bitwise AND operation between the subnet mask and the destination IP Address.
This AND-ing operation is known as the masking operation.
Subnet mask is used for routing a data packet.
It helps identify whether the data packet is intended for the local subnet (local host) or should be sent out to another subnet (remote host).

----------------------------------

4. Explain the ANDing process. Indicate the different outcomes of the Boolean Operator A=B+C.

Localhost is a hostname that means this computer.
It is used to access the network services that are running on the host via its loopback network interface.
Using the loopback interface bypasses any local network interface hardware.
The local loopback mechanism is useful for testing software during development, independently of any networking configurations.
For example, loopback may be used to direct a locally running web browser to http://localhost to display a local html file.

----------------------------------

7. Explain the process of resolving a FQDN to an IP address bearing in mind that the first file that would be accessed for the resolution is the HOSTS file.

----------------------------------

TCP/IP Commands

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Explain the purpose of the Ping command and its possible uses.

Verifies IP-level connectivity to another TCP/IP computer by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo Request messages.
The receipt of corresponding Echo Reply messages are displayed, along with round-trip times.
Ping is the primary TCP/IP command used to troubleshoot connectivity, reachability, and name resolution.
You can use ping to test both the computer name and the IP address of the computer.
If pinging the IP address is successful, but pinging the computer name is not, you might have a name resolution problem.
In this case, ensure that the computer name you are specifying can be resolved through the local Hosts file, by using Domain Name System (DNS) queries, or through NetBIOS name resolution techniques.

----------------------------------

2. Describe an approach to obtaining a description of all the TCP/IP commands. Can it be obtained from the Internet?

https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb727023.aspx
https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/it-ops/top-7-tcpip-utilities-every-networking-pro-should-know

----------------------------------

3. Give a sample application of the Ping command? What is the result of pinging 127.0.0.1?

➜  ~ ping 127.0.0.1
PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.052 ms
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.085 ms
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.080 ms

----------------------------------

4. Explain the term loopback.

Loopback is a communication channel with only one endpoint.
TCP/IP networks specify a loopback that allows client software to communicate with server software on the same computer.
Users can specify an IP address, usually 127.0.0.1, which will point back to the computer's TCP/IP network configuration.
The range of addresses for loopback functionality is the range of 127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255.
Similar to ping, loopback enables a user to test one's own network to ensure the IP stack is functioning properly.

----------------------------------

5. Describe various applications of the IPCONFIG command.
In particular, state the purpose of using different switches with the command.
An example of a switch is /all or /release.

This diagnostic command displays all current TCP/IP network configuration values.
This command is useful on computers running DHCP because it enables users to determine which TCP/IP configuration values have been configured by DHCP.
If you enter only ipconfig without parameters, the response is a display of all of the current TCP/IP configuration values, including IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway.
/all Produces a full display.
Without this switch, ipconfig displays only the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway values for each network card.
renew [adapter] Renews DHCP configuration parameters.
This option is available only on computers running the DHCP Client service.
To specify an adapter name, type the adapter name that appears when you use ipconfig without parameters.
release [adapter] Releases the current DHCP configuration. This option disables TCP/IP on the local computer and is available only on DHCP clients.

----------------------------------

6. What are some of the client identification parameters that could be used with the ping command?
One example would be to ping the IP address of a computer.

-t Pings the specified host until interrupted.
-a Resolves addresses to host names
-n count Sends the number of ECHO packets specified by count.The default is 4.
-l length Sends ECHO packets containing the amount of data specified by length. The default is 64 bytes; the maximum is 8192.
-f Sends a Do Not Fragment flag in the packet. The packet will not be fragmented by gateways on the route.
-i ttl Sets the time to live field to the value specified by ttl.
-v tos Sets the type of service field to the value specified by tos.
-r count Records the route of the outgoing packet and the returning packet in the record route field. A minimum of 1 to a maximum of 9 hosts must be specified by count.
-s count Specifies the timestamp for the number of hops specified by count.
-j host-list Routes packets via the list of hosts specified by host-list. Consecutive hosts can be separated by intermediate gateways (loose source routed). The maximum number allowed by IP is 9.
-k host-list Routes packets via the list of hosts specified by host-list. Consecutive hosts cannot be separated by intermediate gateways (strict source routed). The maximum number allowed by IP is 9.
-w timeout Specifies a timeout interval in milliseconds. destination-list Specifies the remote hosts to ping

----------------------------------

7. List all the useful information displayed in response to the IPCONFIG /all command.
Can the MAC address be obtained from the information displayed?
What is a MAC address? Is it a unique address for each computer on the Internet? - YES

IP Address
Subnet
Gateway
MAC Address

hostname, primary DNS suffix, DHCP, DNS servers, MAC address, IP address , netbios – TCP/IP
A MAC Address, also known as a Physical Address or Burned-in-Address, is just a device identifier.
It’s a long number, 6 bytes to be exact
Usually written in base-16 (Hexadecimal) and represents a unique device address for the purposes of communicating with other devices on a network. – 48 bit

----------------------------------

8. How can a FQDN of a computer be determined from the information displayed in response to the IPCONFIG /all command.

HOSTNAME + Primary DNS Suffix

----------------------------------

9. Give a few different TCP/IP commands that could be used for obtaining the host name of a computer.

Nbtstat, nslookup, ipconfig

----------------------------------

10. State the purpose and functions of each of the following TCP/IP commands: nslookup, tracert, finger and arp.

finger -- user information lookup program
nslookup - query Internet name servers interactively
traceroute -- print the route packets take to network host
arp -- address resolution display and control

----------------------------------

11. What is the purpose of the ARP protocol?

Short for Address Resolution Protocol, a network layer protocol used to convert an IP address into a physical address (called a DLC address), such as an Ethernet address.
A host wishing to obtain a physical address broadcastsan ARP request onto the TCP/IP network.

IP <-> MAC

----------------------------------

12. Explain the information displayed in response to the nslookup, tracert, finger and arp commands

13. What is a hop? Which command displays the route of a packet in terms of hops when the packet hops to the destination computer?

A hop is the distance a data packet travels from one node to the other.
A hop is one portion of the path between source and destination.
Data packets pass through bridges, routers and gateways as they travel between source and destination.
Each time packets are passed to the next network device, a hop occurs.
The hop count refers to the number of intermediate devices through which data must pass between source and destination.
The ping or traceroute commands can be used to see how many router hops it takes to get from one host to another.
