Midterm 2 Review TCP/IP

=========================================================================================================================================

Section 1: Overview of TCP/IP 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. What is meant by the TCP/IP suite of protocols? Explain RFC and IETF in relation to this protocol. 

The Internet protocol suite is the conceptual model and set of communications protocols used on the Internet and similar computer networks. 
It is commonly known as TCP/IP because the original protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).

RFC
Request for Comment 
It is a document published by IETF to define internet related standards, such as TCP/IP.

IETF
Internet Engineering Task Force 
It is a non-profit organization that sets Internet Standards, such as TCP/IP, and publishes the RFCs.

|                                                      OSI(Open System Interconnection)                                                      |                                                        TCP/IP(Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)                                                         |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1. OSI is a generic, protocol independent standard, acting as a communication gateway between the network and end user.                    | 1. TCP/IP model is based on standard protocols around which the Internet has developed. It is a communication protocol, which allows connection of hosts over a network. |
| 2. In OSI model the transport layer guarantees the delivery of packets.                                                                    | 2. In TCP/IP model the transport layer does not guarantees delivery of packets. Still the TCP/IP model is more reliable.                                                 |
| 3. Follows vertical approach.                                                                                                              | 3. Follows horizontal approach.                                                                                                                                          |
| 4. OSI model has a separate Presentation layer and Session layer.                                                                          | 4. TCP/IP does not have a separate Presentation layer or Session layer.                                                                                                  |
| 5. OSI is a reference model around which the networks are built. Generally it is used as a guidance tool.                                  | 5. TCP/IP model is, in a way implementation of the OSI model.                                                                                                            |
| 6. Network layer of OSI model provides both connection oriented and connectionless service.                                                | 6. The Network layer in TCP/IP model provides connectionless service.                                                                                                    |
| 7. OSI model has a problem of fitting the protocols into the model.                                                                        | 7. TCP/IP model does not fit any protocol                                                                                                                                |
| 8. Protocols are hidden in OSI model and are easily replaced as the technology changes.                                                    | 8. In TCP/IP replacing protocol is not easy.                                                                                                                             |
| 9. OSI model defines services, interfaces and protocols very clearly and makes clear distinction between them. It is protocol independent. | 9. In TCP/IP, services, interfaces and protocols are not clearly separated. It is also protocol dependent.                                                               |
| 10. It has 7 layers                                                                                                                        | 10. It has 4 layers                                                                                                                                                      |

3. Name some of the WAN and LAN related protocols in the lower layer of the TCP/IP Model. Differentiate between the two types of protocols.

Doubt

----------------------------------

4. Explain the protocol known as Telnet and its usage. 

Telnet port - 23
It is a network protocol that allows a user on one computer to log onto another computer that is part of the same network.

----------------------------------

5. List some of the upper layer protocols. 

HTTP
SMTP
Telnet
FTP

----------------------------------

6. Explain the purpose and function of the following protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, POP3 IMAP, SNMP, TELNET, TCP, UDP and ARP. Briefly describe incoming and outgoing mail protocols. 

HTTP - 80
Hypertext Transfer (or Transport) Protocol, the data transfer protocol used on the World Wide Web.

HTTPS - 443
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to. The 'S' at the end of HTTPS stands for 'Secure'. It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted.

FTP - 21
The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network.

SMTP - 25
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is a TCP/IP protocol used in sending and receiving e-mail. 

POP3 - 110
Post Office Protocol 3 is a protocol for receiving email by downloading it to your computer from a mailbox on the server of an Internet service provider.

IMAP - 143
IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is a standard email protocol that stores email messages on a mail server, but allows the end user to view and manipulate the messages as though they were stored locally on the end user's computing device(s).

SNMP - 161, 162
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a popular protocol for network management. 
It is used for collecting information from, and configuring, network devices, such as servers, printers, hubs, switches, and routers on an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

Telnet - 23
It is a network protocol that allows a user on one computer to log onto another computer that is part of the same network.

TCP
Transmission Control Protocol
Host-to-Host Transport Layer protocol
One-to-one and connection-oriented reliable protocol (receive acknowledgement). 
Used in the accurate transmission of large amount of data. 
Slower compared to UDP because additional error checking being performed.

UDP
User Datagram Protocol
Host-to-Host Transport Layer protocol
One-to-one or one-to-many, connectionless and unreliable protocol. 

ARP
Address Resolution Protocol
Network layer protocol used to convert an IP address into a physical address

Doubt

----------------------------------

7. What are port numbers? Indicate the de facto port numbers for the above protocols.

TCP requires port numbers on the host and destination for communication. Different port numbers are assigned to different protocols by default. Standard port numbers have been assigned by the Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA).
Note: when using a default port, you do not need to indicate the port number for communication.

DNS
Domain Name System
Application Layer/Operation related protocol
Resolves domain names to IP Addresses and vice versa

----------------------------------

9. Compare and contrast TCP with UDP. Describe one or more scenarios where one of the protocols would be more appropriate than the other. When is UDP Preferred for communication?

| TCP rearranges data packets in the order specified.                                                                                                                | UDP has no inherent order as all packets are independent of each other. If ordering is required, it has to be managed by the application layer. |
| The speed for TCP is slower than UDP.                                                                                                                              | UDP is faster because error recovery is not attempted. It is a "best effort" protocol.                                                          |
| There is absolute guarantee that the data transferred remains intact and arrives in the same order in which it was sent.                                           | There is no guarantee that the messages or packets sent would reach at all.                                                                     |
| TCP header size is 20 bytes                                                                                                                                        | UDP Header size is 8 bytes.                                                                                                                     |
| TCP is heavy-weight. TCP requires three packets to set up a socket connection, before any user data can be sent. TCP handles reliability and congestion control.   | UDP is lightweight. There is no ordering of messages, no tracking connections, etc. It is a small transport layer designed on top of IP.        |
| TCP does Flow Control. TCP requires three packets to set up a socket connection, before any user data can be sent. TCP handles reliability and congestion control. | UDP does not have an option for flow control                                                                                                    |
| TCP does error checking and error recovery. Erroneous packets are retransmitted from the source to the destination.                                                | UDP does error checking but simply discards erroneous packets. Error recovery is not attempted.                                                 |

10. Explain the terms connection-oriented and connection-less protocols. Include in the discussion, the terms reliable and unreliable communications.

Connection-Oriented protocol
They perform handshaking to set up an end-to-end connection
Connection-Oriented systems can only work in bi-directional communications environments. 
Connection-oriented protocol services are often reliable network services, that provide acknowledgment after successful delivery.

Connectionless protocol 
Usually achieved by transmitting information in one direction, from source to destination without checking to see if the destination is still there, or if it is prepared to receive the information.
IP, UDP, ICMP, DNS, TFTP and SNMP are examples of connectionless protocols in use on the Internet.
Connectionless transmissions are considered unreliable because the service provider usually cannot guarantee that there will be errors in the delivery of the packet.
