Midterm 2 Review TCP/IP

=========================================================================================================================================

Section 1: Overview of TCP/IP 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. What is meant by the TCP/IP suite of protocols? Explain RFC and IETF in relation to this protocol. 

The Internet protocol suite is the conceptual model and set of communications protocols used on the Internet and similar computer networks. 
It is commonly known as TCP/IP because the original protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).

RFC
Request for Comment 
It is a document published by IETF to define internet related standards, such as TCP/IP.

IETF
Internet Engineering Task Force 
It is a non-profit organization that sets Internet Standards, such as TCP/IP, and publishes the RFCs.

2. How many layers are there in the TCP/IP model? Label each layer. Compare the layers in the TCP/IP model to the layers in the ISO/OSI model.

TCP/IP -> 4 layers

|                                                      OSI(Open System Interconnection)                                                      |                                                        TCP/IP(Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)                                                         |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1. OSI is a generic, protocol independent standard, acting as a communication gateway between the network and end user.                    | 1. TCP/IP model is based on standard protocols around which the Internet has developed. It is a communication protocol, which allows connection of hosts over a network. |
| 2. In OSI model the transport layer guarantees the delivery of packets.                                                                    | 2. In TCP/IP model the transport layer does not guarantees delivery of packets. Still the TCP/IP model is more reliable.                                                 |
| 3. Follows vertical approach.                                                                                                              | 3. Follows horizontal approach.                                                                                                                                          |
| 4. OSI model has a separate Presentation layer and Session layer.                                                                          | 4. TCP/IP does not have a separate Presentation layer or Session layer.                                                                                                  |
| 5. OSI is a reference model around which the networks are built. Generally it is used as a guidance tool.                                  | 5. TCP/IP model is, in a way implementation of the OSI model.                                                                                                            |
| 6. Network layer of OSI model provides both connection oriented and connectionless service.                                                | 6. The Network layer in TCP/IP model provides connectionless service.                                                                                                    |
| 7. OSI model has a problem of fitting the protocols into the model.                                                                        | 7. TCP/IP model does not fit any protocol                                                                                                                                |
| 8. Protocols are hidden in OSI model and are easily replaced as the technology changes.                                                    | 8. In TCP/IP replacing protocol is not easy.                                                                                                                             |
| 9. OSI model defines services, interfaces and protocols very clearly and makes clear distinction between them. It is protocol independent. | 9. In TCP/IP, services, interfaces and protocols are not clearly separated. It is also protocol dependent.                                                               |
| 10. It has 7 layers                                                                                                                        | 10. It has 4 layers                                                                                                                                                      |
